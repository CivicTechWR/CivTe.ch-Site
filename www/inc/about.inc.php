	<p class="lead">CivicTechWR is an inclusive multi-disciplinary group that aims to connect citizens, civic innovators, technologists, community groups, governments, and entrepreneurs with civic tech initiatives. We strive to empower them to work together, exchange ideas and tools to improve the lives of the residents in and around Waterloo Region through civic technology.

				Once a month, we host a leader from the community, to speak to the group. This could be someone from a local non-profit, from government, from industry, or any citizen - what matters is that they have something to share with our group, something to teach us, or something to inspire us. 
 
Every week, we provide space for people to come and work together on civic tech projects. Ideally, any space we use has great WiFi, power, and whiteboards. These meetings occur on Tuesday to make sure it's possible to collaborate with Toronto and Ottawa Civic Tech Teams.
